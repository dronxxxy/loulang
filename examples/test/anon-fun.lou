    Anonymous funcions works like standard funtions declared in global 
    scope, but they can access declarations of outer functions. It is 
    worth noting that you cannot access locals of outer functions.

                Anonymous functions != Closures (or Lambdas)
  `#
  return fun () -> i32 {
    putCStringC(c"hello") # You can call putCStringC declared in outer function because it is a constant
    putCString(c"world")  # Of course, you can also call global values
                          # But you cannot call putCStringVar because it is lives in another stack frame
    return 0
  }()
})
